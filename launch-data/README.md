## Flightlog for the mcu-rocket project

This is a flightlog for `Mission A: NANO-Rocket`.

### Flight 0  
  - Name: Flight 0 
  - Date: June 23, 2021
  - Location: TNTech 'Tech Village' Parking Lot
  - Purpose: Rocket Design Stabilty Testing
  - Conditions: 
    - Temp: HOT ~85 F
    - Wind: Mild <5 MPH
    - Visibility: clear, blue sky
  
  - Vehicle: NANO-Rocket-0
    - Propulsion: Single Stage C6-5
    - Payload: Approximate Weight of Flight contoller in nosecone
    - Recovery: x1 small estes parachute
  
  - Losses: 1 nose cone cap, part: 'nose_cone_A'
  - Damage: 1 tail fin destroyed on landing 

  - Overview: The launch was a success. The rocket was launched two times. Both times the rocket veered parabolically to the North. Fortunately 
    everything except one nosecone cap recovered.

### Flight 1  
  - Name: Flight 1 
  - Date: June 24, 2021
  - Location: TNTech 'Tech Village' Parking Lot
  - Purpose: Initial Data Collection Testing - Orienation
  - Conditions: 
    - Temp: HOT ~85 F
    - Wind: Mild ~5 MPH (sligtly windier that 06/23)
    - Visibility: clear, blue sky
  
  - Vehicle: NANO-Rocket-0 
    - Propulsion: Single Stage C6-5
    - Payload: 
      - Flight Computer (nano 328p)
      - Sensor Package (BNO055 + DPS310)
    - Recovery: x1 small estes parachute
  
  - Losses: 1 nose cone cap cracked and chiped
  - Damage: 1 tail fin destroyed on landing 

  - Overview: The launch was a success. The rocket was launched once and it flew very straight. The rocket lost speed during the coasting period and began to fall before the parachute was deployed. I think was because the rocket was too heavy.

### Flight 2  
  - Name: Flight 2 
  - Date: June 24, 2021
  - Location: TNTech 'Tech Village' Parking Lot
  - Purpose: Payload Weight Performance Test. 
  - Conditions: 
    - Temp: HOT ~85 F
    - Wind: Mild ~5 MPH (sligtly windier that 06/23)
    - Visibility: clear, blue sky
  
  - Vehicle: NANO-Rocket-1 
    - Propulsion: Single Stage C6-5
    - Payload: nothing
    - Recovery: x1 small estes parachute
  
  - Losses: 1 nose cone cap cracked and chiped
  - Damage: 1 tail fin destroyed on landing 

  - Overview: The launch was a success. The rocket was launched once and it flew very straight, very fast, and very high. Appogee was approximately twice that of the previous flight which contained the flight computer and sensor package as the payload. As expected the mass of the rocket significantly affects the performance of the rocket.
