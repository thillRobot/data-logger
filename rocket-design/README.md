# This page describes the design and construction of the launch vehicle for Mission A: Nano-Rocket

Note: This page is specific to `Mission A: Nano-Rocket`. For information about a different vehicle or mission, select the appropriate branch.

## Overview 

The primary goal is to design and construct a safe and low-cost model rocket capable of carrying a flight computer and sensor package as the payload in the nosecone. The rocket design shoud be suitable for construction with a typical FDM 3D printer and available building materials.

## Design History of Nano-Rocket

### Nosecone Design

I made these designs with Autodesk Fusion 360 using the hobbyist license. This is not my favorite CAD program, but it is nice for small projects. The part construction seems straightforward, but assembly seems to be missing a way to set mates in the traditional way. The developers have claimed that the added joints instead of mates, but I have not quite figured out how they work yet. 

Nosecone V1 
  - First Draft in CAD
  - After printing the first protoype it was clear that the split cone design was not going to work.
